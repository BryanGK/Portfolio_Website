      <h3>More about me</h3>
      <p>In 2007 I was working in a mall kiosk, it was not a career type job. Having done some career reaseach, I
        decided
        that the electrical trade was my best option for get a 'real' job. As an electrician I earned the rank
        of job
        foreman. Running a multitude of complex electrical projects, including brand new gas stations from the
        ground up, I
        rose to be the top foreman at Allied Power & Communication. Something however was missing. I was not
        happy doing that
        type of work. Joining the union was the next step, I thought this would bring job satisfaction by making
        more money.
        That was wrong. Going from Raylec Power doing infrastructure then to Victoria Shipyard on Navy vessel
        maitenance,
        nothing felt right.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>My partner was intrumental in helping me along this journey, she was the one who recommended I try
        getting into the
        tech sector. After doing some research I decided to enroll in the UI design program at CareerFoundry.
        While I began
        the course at CareerFoundry everything was great. Until I stumbled upon coding and web development. Part
        of what draws
        me to coding and development is the problem solving challenge. That feeling you get when you finally get
        that piece of
        code to work properly. My years of fixing malfunctioning electrical equipment has honed my
        troubleshooting skills.
        That along with being a self-starter and highly motivated will help me get the career I want.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In my younger years computers and programming always held my interest. My Dad had the latest PC's for me
        to
        play with, and I took some computer studies in high school. When I got older and had to decide on a
        career, my options
        were limited as I was living on my own and had minimal financial resources. Now that I am more
        established I've been
        able to take the time off work to learn enough to get started in a career doing what I love. Now I spend
        all my time
        learning about tech knowing that one day my hard work will pay off.

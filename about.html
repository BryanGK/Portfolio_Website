                <h3>More about me</h3>
                <p>In 2007 I was working in a mall kiosk, it was not a career type job. Having done some career reaseach, I decided
                    that the electrical trade was my best option for get a 'real' job. As an electrician I earned the rank of job 
                    foreman. Running a multitude of complex electrical projects, including brand new gas stations from the ground up, I
                    rose to be the top foreman at Allied Power & Communication. Something however was missing. I was not happy doing that
                    type of work. Joining the union was the next step, I thought this would bring job satisfaction by making more money.
                    That was wrong. Going from Raylec Power doing infrastructure then to Victoria Shipyard on Navy vessel maitenance,
                    nothing felt right.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>My partner was intrumental in helping me along this journey, she was the one who recommended I try getting into the 
                    tech sector. After doing some research I decided to enroll in the UI design program at CareerFoundry. While I began
                    the course at CareerFoundry everything was great. Until I stumbled upon coding and web development. Part of what draws
                    me to coding and development is the problem solving challenge. That feeling you get when you finally get that piece of
                    code to work properly. My years of fixing malfunctioning electrical equipment has honed my troubleshooting skills.
                    That along with being a self-starter and highly motivated will help me get the career I want.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>In my younger years computers and programming always held my interest. My Dad had the latest PC's for me to
                    play with, and I took some computer studies in high school. When I got older and had to decide on a career, my options 
                    were limited as I was living on my own and had minimal financial resources. Now that I am more established I've been 
                    able to take the time off work to learn enough to get started in a career doing what I love. Now I spend all my time 
                    learning about tech knowing that one day my hard work will pay off.
